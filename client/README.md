# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Ensure that you open 2 terminals:
    On first terminal cd into the client with the command "cd client"
        Then type "npm run dev" and you will get a connection

    On Second terminal cd into the server with the command "cd server"
        Then type "npm start" and you wuill get a database connection

These two terminals are needed to run the frontend and backend of this project.
